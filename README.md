# Credit-Card-Classification
To strenghten my understanding of classification and work on the data cleaning and transformation, I will perform a classification model on data regarding credit card applications. The dataset is derived from Univerisity of California - Irvine and its machine learning respository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data, being named from _A1_ to _A16_. This dataset is interesting because there is a good mix of attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values. There are also a few missing values. I will clean this data in such a way that I can predict _A16_ being "+". To do this, I will develop the best model for this task  and create linear probability models of _A16_ being "+", and complementing these with logistic regression models. Using the results from these models, I will compute the accuracy on the testing data and summarize the most representative model. Please view my jupyter notebook to view my findings!
